Hello!
My name is Radek and I am a beginner programer. Currently I am learning various languages like JavaScript, Java, Python and others. Besides programming I develop my own electronic devices and circuites. I am also a amateur 3D CAD designer (FreeCad software).
If you want, you can contact me through my email: marszalek01radek@gmail.com
